These pages should help researchers to get started for setting up a Python environment on their machines. The guide has grown out of some courses that I `teach in Bonn <http://www.wiwi.uni-bonn.de/gaudecker/teaching.html>`_ and at some points you will find references for students. Just ignore them if you're not one of them.

* Please `drop me a line <mailto:hmgaudecker@gmail.com>`_ or `open an issue on Github <https://github.com/hmgaudecker/econ-python-environment/issues/new>`_ if any links are outdated or descriptions are unclear.
* If everything goes smoothly and you have a fast machine and a fast Internet connection, you should be done within half an hour.
* Please follow the steps one-by-one in and do not deviate AT ALL from them, unless you **really** know what you are doing.
