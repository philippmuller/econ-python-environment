These pages should help researchers to get started for setting up a Python environment on their machines. The guide has grown out of some courses that I have been `teaching <http://www.wiwi.uni-bonn.de/gaudecker/teaching.html>`_ and at some points you will find references for students of these courses. Just ignore them if you do not belong to this group.

* If everything goes smoothly and you have a fast machine and a fast Internet connection, you should be done within half an hour.
* Please follow the steps one-by-one in and do not deviate **at all** from them, unless you **really** know what you are doing.
* If you find any outdated links or unclear descriptions, I would appreciate if you `dropped me a line <mailto:hmgaudecker@gmail.com>`_ or `opened an issue on Github <https://github.com/hmgaudecker/econ-python-environment/issues/new>`_.
